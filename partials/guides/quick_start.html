  <h3 class='dark-blue'>We have a Sandbox to play in!</h3>
  <p>If you're just starting out with the API and are worried about making any mistakes or lasting changes to your Live account, we've created a completely separate Sandbox environment for you to play with.</p>
  <p>Just use <b class='dark-blue-link'>sandbox.gonebusy.com</b> below instead of the Live <b class='dark-blue-link'>beta.gonebusy.com</b> site, including where you login to retrieve your API key.</p>
  <p>Have fun!</p>

  <h4>Step 1 &ndash; Obtain an API Key</h4>
  <p>To obtain an API Key, you must be registered as a Gonebusy User.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>From your user dashboard, find the "API Key" tab on the left-hand navigation bar.</p></li>
    <li><p>After agreeing to the Terms & Conditions of API access and usage, you will be issued an API Key.</p></li>
    <li><p>Keep this Key private.  If you lose the Key, or feel it has been compromised, you can request another Key, which will make any previous keys invalid.</p></li>
    <li><p>Use the Key to construct an Authorization header for every request.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Example Authorization header:</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
  "Authorization": "Token ac98ed08b5b0a9e7c43a233aeba841ce"
{% endhighlight %}

  <h4>Step 2 &ndash; Create a Service</h4>
  <p>Now that your User has been created, let’s create the first Service that this User will offer.</p>
  <p>By default, the created Service is associated with the current
  User’s default Resource.</p>
  <p>Creating the Service will also create a Schedule for the default
  Resource.  We will use the returned Schedule id in the next step.</p>
  <p>Here is a sample POST request to create a Service for our sample User:</p>
  <h3 class="dark-blue">Request:</h3>
{% highlight ruby %}
https://beta.gonebusy.com/api/v1/services/new.json
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>with POST body:</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
{
  "name": "LSAT/MCAT Tutoring",
  "description": "Tutoring for LSAT or MCAT exams. Available by the hour.",
  "duration": 60
}
{% endhighlight %}
  <h3 class='dark-blue push-down'>Response:</h3>
{% highlight ruby %}
  "Status": "201 Created"

  {
    "service": {
      "id": 4183,
      "owner_id": 54,
      "name": "LSAT/MCAT Tutoring",
      "short_name": null,
      "duration": 60,
      "max_duration": 60,
      "description": "Tutoring for LSAT or MCAT exams. Available by the hour.",

      "is_active": true,
      "categories": [ ],
      "resources": [ 267 ],
      "schedules": [ 8090 ]
    }
  }
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>Note: You can provide optional parameters in
  order to associate the Service with other managed Resource(s) and
  have corresponding Schedules created for each Resource.
  For more information on the Resource associated with a User,
  see <a ui-sref="entities({'#' : 'resources'})">Resources</a>.  For
  the full list of Service creation parameters
  see <a ui-sref="services({'#' : 'post_services_new'})">POST
  /services/new</a>.</p>

<section class='anchor-container push-down' id='step_3'>
  <h4>Step 3 &ndash; Add a TimeWindow to our Service's Schedule</h4>
  <p>Now that a new Service has been created and associated with the default
  Resource for the current API User, we need to add a TimeWindow to
  the new Schedule that was also created, in order to specify when
  exactly the Service will be offered by the Resource.</p>
  <p>Let’s add the following TimeWindow to the Schedule for our “LSAT/MCAT Tutoring” Service:</p>
  <p><em><b>“Starting November 1st until January 31st, available every Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 4pm to 11pm”</b></em></p>
  <p>The following POST request will add a TimeWindow to our Schedule that corresponds to the above availability:</p>
